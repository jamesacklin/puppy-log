# puppy-log

My wife and I got a puppy. She's a Standard Poodle named Greta. Both of us work within walking distance of our apartment, so one of us checks on the dog during the day. We usually send a simple status update to let the other know the dog is OK and behaving normally.

`puppy-log` is a Python program to log the dog's normal daytime activity during a midday workday visit. I don't have much experience with Python, so I'm using this as an exercise to learn object storage and retrival with an ORM.
